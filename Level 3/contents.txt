Jenkins is one of the most popular, widely used open-source tools for 
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). Travis CI, 
Circle CI, TeamCity, Bamboo, Azure Pipeline, etc. are the other options 
that can be used in Jenkins’s place, but I prefer Jenkins, 
an ‘open-source tool’ above these options.
