Dictionary Views
================
The objects returned by dict.keys(), dict.values() and dict.items() are view objects.  They provide a dynamic 
view on the dictionaryâ€™s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes.
The view returned is essentially a list.  However, the view object has the best of both worlds: it behaves as 
a list container, and yet does not make a copy of the dictionary! It is, in fact, a kind of a virtual read-only 
container that works by linking to the underlying dictionary.  Furthermore, it is easy to created a separate
list from the view.

Because the view is a link to the dict it can be created almost instaneously, whereas creating a seperate list
takes a lot of time.

Let's take a look at how this works with dict.values().

from timeit import Timer

d = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6}
k = d.values()      # read only view

# convert to a list
l = list(k)
print(f"list: {l}")

# check type
print(f"type: {type(k)}")

# print the values view
print(f"view: {k}")
d['one'] = 99

# check the view has changed
print(f"updated view: {k}")

# check the list hasn't changed
print(f"list: {l}")

# now look at timings

n = 200 * 1000 * 1000
d = dict.fromkeys(range(n))

# build a large dict
duration = Timer(stmt=f'dict.fromkeys(range({n}))').timeit(number=1)
print(f"created dict in {duration:6.2f} secs")

# compare that with creating a tuple of keys (slow)
duration = Timer(stmt='x = tuple(d.keys())', setup='from __main__ import d').timeit(number=1)
print(f"created list of keys in {duration:6.2f} secs")

# now create a view from large dict (very fast)
duration = Timer(stmt='x = d.keys()', setup='from __main__ import d').timeit(number=1)
print(f"created dict view of keys in {duration:6.2f} secs")
