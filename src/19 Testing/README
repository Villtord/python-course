Unit testing is the process of testing the small units of the program. This is done to make sure that each unit 
of the program is designed and working properly. Tests are also very helpful when upgrading software; run the original tests
to make sure enhancements do not introduce errors into the existing code.

The following modules are provided by Python for this purpose:
            PyTest
            Unittest
            Nose2
            DocTest
            Testify
