'''
Design a three dimensional Vector class that use Numpy and overloads the following operators:
        v1 + v2
        v1 - v2
        v * constant
        v / constant
        __str__
        __mod__

where |v| is the distance from the origin.

Add a further refinement by overloading the 6 comparison operators, based on distance from the origin.
        |v1| > |v2| etc
