epd\_main
=========

a simple Python entrypoint demonstration

--------------

Install this package first and look at ``my_tools`` in
``epd_main/__init__.py``. This takes the 3 functions in
``epd_main/tools.py`` and give you a slightly different interface to
them. To se why we bother, see the ``epd_plugin`` package.
